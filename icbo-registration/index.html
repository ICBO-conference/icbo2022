<p>The International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO) 2022 is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for all participants. We are working with the University of Michigan (U-M) on implementing preventive measures to reduce the potential spread of the COVID-19 virus. Our preventive measures and policies are guided by the requirements and recommendations of the U.S. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> and federal, state and local health authorities, as well as the health and safety requirements for <a href="https://healthresponse.umich.edu/faqs/#events-gatherings">U-M events</a>. These requirements change frequently; up-to-date requirements will be communicated to registered ICBO 2022 attendees shortly before the meeting. Based on past experience, these U-M, local, state and federal requirements may include policies regarding vaccination, negative COVID-19 tests, social distancing and/or masking. Note that international travelers should additionally monitor the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftravelers%2Ftesting-international-air-travelers.html">CDC requirements</a> regarding entry into the United States.</p>
<p>The responsibility for a safe and healthy event environment is shared by every participant. All ICBO 2022 Meeting participants are expected to adhere to and abide by health and safety precautions implemented for the meeting as well as other government and facility regulations. As part of your Duty of Care responsibilities, you should not attend the ICBO 2022 Meeting if you:

<em> Are experiencing, or have recently experienced <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">symptoms of COVID-19</a>, and have not yet ended isolation, as required by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Fquarantine-isolation.html">CDC guidance</a>.<br />
</em> Believe that you may have been exposed to a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, and have not yet ended quarantine as required by CDC guidance. <br />
