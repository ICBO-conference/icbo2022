The Chinese Conference on Biomedical Ontology and Terminology (CCBOT) is an annual academic conference series focusing on developing and applying bio-ontologies in China. 

CCBOT 2022 will be held on Sep 28-29, 2022 in Beijing. The conference will be hosted by the National Population Health Data Center (NPHDC, http://www.ncmi.cn) at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The theme of this conference is “FAIR ontology making scientific data more FAIR”. CCBOT2022 will be a virtual conference. The audiences from all over the nation will take part in the conference online. 

CCBOT2022 also is a joint conference of ICBO2022. We will invite some plenary speakers to show their speeches for our meeting. We also invited some scholars domestic in China to introduce their progress, especially in semantic standardization and data stewardship.
