# The first FAIR Ontology Harmonization and TRUST Data Interoperability Workshop (FOHTI-22) 
Co-organized by [Asiyah Y. Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dryulin/), [Gary Berg-Cross](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-berg-cross-53a1242/), and [Nomi Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nomiharris/) 

This web page includes two sections: (1) [Workshop Overview](#workshop-overview), and (ii) [Schedule Details](#schedule-details).

## Workshop Overview 
Many diverse ontologies and, increasingly, knowledge graphs (KGs) and other semantic resources have been developed across the biomedical and other domains. Although ontologies and associated KGs are often developed and used for specific needs there may be common knowledge across a specific domain as well as at a higher level, making some degree of knowledge and data alignment possible across many domains. To avoid organizations spending time and resources to model and represent that common knowledge, it is desirable to develop some consensus on a range of relevant semantic resources. Many types of these semantic resources exist along a semantic spectrum that includes structured vocabularies and high-level domain ontologies to support a wide range of use cases.

A relevant context for this work is the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) principle and the Transparency, Responsibility, User Focus, Sustainability (TRUST) principle, which have been established and accepted by the global scientific community for digital objects. Can these principles also be applied to ontologies and other semantic resources which support ample opportunities for data discovery, trust, sharing, reuse and value of various datasets; as well as enabling wide access to dataset quality information? To accomplish all these goals at the data level, FAIR and TRUSTworthy ontology harmonization is an important first step. To do this we need to develop, improve, and disseminate community agreed upon best practices for harmonizing semantic resources at all levels.

This workshop aims to look for examples, technologies, and methodologies utilized for developing FAIR ontology and harmonization, as well as to discuss how harmonization across the semantic spectrum will facilitate data interoperability and the TRUST principle. In this workshop, we will discuss what has worked to create FAIR and TRUST principles that can help harmonize semantic resources, and what FAIR and TRUSTworthy domain-engaged semantic resource harmonization governance might look like.
