# ICBO 2022 Hotel Options
**Note:** Due to a football game at Ann Arbor on September 24, it may be difficult to book a hotel room on
September 24 in Ann Arbor. If you would like to come on September 24, one suggestion is to reserve a hotel room outside Ann Arbor, and then reserve the other nights after September 24 inside Ann Arbor. We will also consider transportation early on September 25 if there is a need.  

We have put together a Google Doc with informaton about [ICBO 2022 hotel options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_set_ag3YpJvE7QBmcvEUX41IYTY-R7p/edit). We update the document as often as possible.
