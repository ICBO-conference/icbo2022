2021 theme and text:
The theme for the 2021 conference is Ontologies for Global Challenges. This includes: 
Ontologies relating to COVID-19
Ontologies relating to the climate crisis and the UN’s sustainable development goals
Ontologies overcoming barriers between basic research and translation
Ontologies in support of mitigating the reproducibility crisis in scientific research
Ontology as a tool for open science to reduce segregation of research results and improve access to the full body of knowledge across scientific disciplines, especially as applied to urgent topics such as the climate crisis
Ontologies in practice across national boundaries, e.g. medical ontologies needing to serve international contexts
Ontology in translation: ontologies supporting knowledge, data and applications in multiple languages
Overcoming the practical boundaries of ontologies in integrated applications including data annotation, data integration, data science, machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies

 Themes for ICBO 2019
Ontological Realism & Alternative Approaches in the context of biological and biomedical data
Genetics, Phenotypes, Disease, and Ontology across biology and medicine
Ontology in Service of Healthcare Data Infrastructure and Analysis
Use of ontologies for data infrastructure needs, including reporting services, cohort discovery, and data warehousing
Using OBO ontologies in coordination with non-OBO ontologies (e.g., SNOMED)
Lessons from ontological analysis of large EHR systems, VA data, etc.
Integration of medical and non-medical data (e.g., integrating disease diagnosis with geographic information)
Methods to improve data translation/annotation processes, including NLP and machine learning
